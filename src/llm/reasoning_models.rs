//! Reasoning/thinking model detection utilities.
//!
//! Models with native thinking support produce structured chain-of-thought
//! via `reasoning_content` fields or built-in `<think>` tags. Injecting
//! BetterClaw's own `<think>/<final>` format instructions into the system
//! prompt collides with these models' native behavior, causing:
//! - Thinking-only responses with no visible content
//! - Double-wrapped thinking tags that confuse response cleaning
//!
//! When a model has native thinking, we skip the `<think>/<final>` prompt
//! injection and let the model use its own format. The response cleaning
//! pipeline already handles stripping all known thinking tag variants.
//!
//! ## Design note: why match broadly (e.g. all Qwen3)?
//!
//! Some families (Qwen3) have ALL variants trained with native `<think>` tags,
//! even tiny models like 0.6B. Thinking can be disabled at inference time via
//! `enable_thinking=false`, but we can't detect that from the model name alone.
//! We err on the safe side: skip injection for all variants because:
//! - False negative (inject when model thinks natively) = broken responses
//! - False positive (skip injection for non-thinking model) = less structured
//!   but working responses
//!
//! For families where only SOME variants reason (GLM-4), we match specific
//! sub-families (glm-z1, glm-4-plus) to avoid false positives.
