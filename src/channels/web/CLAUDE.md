## SSE Event Types (`SseEvent` in `types.rs`)

The SSE contract — every field is `#[serde(tag = "type")]`:

| Type | When emitted |
|------|-------------|
| `response` | Final text response from agent |
| `stream_chunk` | Streaming token (partial response) |
| `thinking` | Agent status update during reasoning |
| `tool_started` | Tool call began |
| `tool_completed` | Tool call finished (includes success/error) |
| `tool_result` | Tool output preview |
| `status` | Generic status message |
| `job_started` | Sandbox job created |
| `job_message` | Message from sandbox worker |
| `job_tool_use` | Tool invoked inside sandbox |
| `job_tool_result` | Tool result from sandbox |
| `job_status` | Sandbox job status update |
| `job_result` | Sandbox job final result |
| `approval_needed` | Tool requires user approval (pauses agent) |
| `auth_required` | Extension needs auth credentials |
| `auth_completed` | Extension auth flow finished |
| `extension_status` | WASM channel activation status changed |
| `error` | Error from agent or gateway |
| `heartbeat` | SSE keepalive (empty payload) |

**SSE serialization:** Events use `#[serde(tag = "type")]` — the wire format is `{"type":"<variant>", ...fields}`. The SSE frame's `event:` field is set to the same string as `type` for easy `addEventListener` use in the browser.

**WebSocket envelope:** Over WebSocket, SSE events are wrapped as `{"type":"event","event_type":"<variant>","data":{...}}`. Ping/pong uses `{"type":"ping"}` / `{"type":"pong"}`. Client-to-server messages (`message`, `approval`, `auth_token`, `auth_cancel`) are defined in `WsClientMessage` in `types.rs`.

**To add a new SSE event:** Use the `add-sse-event` skill (`/add-sse-event`). It scaffolds the Rust variant, serialization, broadcast call, and frontend handler. Also add a matching arm to `WsServerMessage::from_sse_event()` in `types.rs`.

## Auth

All protected routes require `Authorization: Bearer <GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN>`. The token is set via `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` env var. Missing/wrong token → 401. The `Bearer` prefix is compared case-insensitively (RFC 6750).

**Query-string token auth (`?token=xxx`):** Because `EventSource` and WebSocket upgrades cannot set custom headers from the browser, three endpoints also accept the token as a URL query parameter: `/api/chat/events`, `/api/logs/events`, and `/api/chat/ws`. All other endpoints reject query-string tokens. If you add a new SSE or WebSocket endpoint, register its path in `allows_query_token_auth()` in `auth.rs`.

**If no `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured**, a random 32-character alphanumeric token is generated at startup and printed to the console.

Rate limiting: chat send endpoints are capped at **30 messages per 60 seconds** (sliding window, not per-IP).

## GatewayState

The shared state struct (`server.rs`) holds refs to all subsystems. Fields are `Option<Arc<T>>` so the gateway can start even when optional subsystems (workspace, sandbox, skills) are disabled. Always null-check before use in handlers.

Key fields:
- `msg_tx` — `RwLock<Option<mpsc::Sender<IncomingMessage>>>` — sends messages to the agent loop; set when `start()` is called on the `Channel`.
- `sse` — `SseManager` — broadcast hub; call `state.sse.broadcast(event)` from any handler.
- `ws_tracker` — `Option<Arc<WsConnectionTracker>>` — tracks WS connection count separately from SSE.
- `chat_rate_limiter` — `RateLimiter` — 30 req/60 s sliding window shared across all chat send callers.
- `scheduler` — `Option<SchedulerSlot>` — used to inject follow-up messages into running agent jobs.
- `cost_guard` — `Option<Arc<CostGuard>>` — exposes token usage / cost totals in the status endpoint.
- `startup_time` — `Instant` — used to compute uptime in the gateway status response.
- `registry_entries` — `Vec<RegistryEntry>` — loaded once at startup from registry manifests; used by the available extensions API without hitting the network.

Subsystems are wired via `with_*` builder methods on `GatewayChannel` (`mod.rs`). Each call rebuilds `Arc<GatewayState>` — safe to call before `start()`, not after.

## SSE / WebSocket Connection Limits

Both SSE and WebSocket share the same `SseManager` broadcast channel. Key characteristics:

- **Broadcast buffer:** 256 events. A slow client that falls behind will miss events — the `BroadcastStream` silently drops lagged events. SSE clients are expected to reconnect and re-fetch history.
- **Max connections:** 100 total (SSE + WebSocket combined). Connections beyond the limit receive a 503 / are immediately dropped.
- **SSE keepalive:** Axum's `KeepAlive` sends an empty event every **30 seconds** to prevent proxy timeouts.
- **WebSocket:** Two tasks per connection — a sender task (broadcast → WS frames) and a receiver loop (WS frames → agent). When the client disconnects, the sender is aborted and both the SSE connection counter and WS tracker counter are decremented.

## CORS and Security Headers

CORS is restricted to the gateway's own origin (same IP+port and `localhost`+port). Allowed methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Allowed headers: `Content-Type`, `Authorization`. Credentials are allowed.

All responses include:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

**Request body limit:** 1 MB (`DefaultBodyLimit::max(1024 * 1024)`). Larger payloads return 413.

## Pending Approvals

Tool approval state is **in-memory only** (not persisted to DB). Server restart clears all pending approvals. The `pending_approval` field in `HistoryResponse` is re-populated on thread switch from in-memory state.

## Adding a New API Endpoint

1. Define request/response types in `types.rs`.
2. Implement the handler in the appropriate `handlers/*.rs` file (or inline in `server.rs` for simple handlers).
3. Register the route in `start_server()` in `server.rs` under the correct router (`public`, `protected`, or `statics`).
4. If it is an SSE or WebSocket endpoint, add its path to `allows_query_token_auth()` in `auth.rs`.
5. If it requires a new `GatewayState` field, add it to the struct and to both the `GatewayChannel::new()` initializer and `rebuild_state()` in `mod.rs`, then add a `with_*` builder method.
